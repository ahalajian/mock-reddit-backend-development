I have created a Reddit style community forum where people can make posts and make comments on posts. I have used the Flask framework to set up routes and respond to network requests. I have implemented a series of routes where one can send get, post, and delete requests to create a post, get a specific post, delete a specific post, post a comment, etc.

I have also used the API platform Postman to test my routes by sending requests to my API. I have attached my collection of Postman tests, with my request bodies typed in for POST requests.
